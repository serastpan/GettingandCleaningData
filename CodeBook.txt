MORE INFO ABOUT DATA: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Data comes from accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S series. 30 subjects were asked to do 6 activities: WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING
, STANDING
 and LAYING
. The monitoring of these activities were registrated by the accelerometers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"run_analysis.R" is a R script which tidy data provided by Data Source. This script carries out the following steps:
1.- Download data from "Data Source" and store it in a folder called "Data".
2.- Look for the path of the files and read the files where raw data is stored.
3.- Add "subject" and "activity" variables to train and test datasets according to "y_train.txt", "y_test.txt", "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt".
4.- Merge data from test and training data.
5.- Assign names to each one of the variables according to "features.txt".
6.- Extract mean and standard deviation variables from each measurement.
7.- Assign more descriptive variable names.
8.- Create an independent tidy dataset with subjects and activities splited so that each variable contains one observation.
9.- Write the tidy dataset to "TidyDataSet.txt" file text.
